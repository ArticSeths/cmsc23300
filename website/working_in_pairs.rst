Working in Pairs
================

In this class, you will be developing the course projects in pairs. This is not a gratuitous
decision: in practically all contexts, software development is a team sport, and you will
develop many useful skills by doing these projects in pairs rather than by working on them
individually.

However, working with others can be as challenging as it is rewarding. In this page,
we provide a number of suggestions and tips that can help you make the most out of
working on a software project with others, particularly in the context of a university
course.

Choosing a project partner
--------------------------

The first thing you need to do is find a project partner. Choosing your project
partner is not something to take lightly, nor should you just pair up with the
first person who happens to be available. You and your project partner will
be depending on each other throughout the quarter, and you want to make sure
you work well together as a team before you commit to spending ten weeks
together working on the course projects.

Ideally, there is someone in the class that you've worked with before (this
doesn't have to be on a course project; maybe you've worked together in
a student organization, in an on-campus job, etc.). If you know that the two
of you already work well together and, more importantly, feel like you
can rely on each other, then you'll likely work well together in
this class, although you may nonetheless want to have a discussion on
some of the issues we discuss below.

What if you don't know anyone in the class? This is perfectly normal! (and
there will be a lot of other students in that same situation) However, you
may want to consider the following before pairing up with someone:

- *Preferred means of communication*: As we'll discuss below, communication
  is a key aspect of succeeding as a team. The two of you will need to be
  able to easily reach each other (sometimes frequently and on short notice);
  make sure the two of you have at least one messaging platform (Messenger, Slack,
  texting, etc.) that you already use and where you can be easily reached.

- *Work schedules*: Make sure you have compatible work schedules. If you're
  a night owl, and your project partner is a morning person, or if you
  expect to do most of your work on weekends but your partner doesn't, then
  you may find it difficult to meet and to communicate throughout the quarter.

- *Level of experience*: You will usually want to pair up with someone that is
  at your same level. If you're a fourth year who is almost done with the CS major,
  and you pair up with a second year who is fresh out of the intro sequence,
  you may get frustrated by the fact that your partner progresses more slowly
  through the projects.

  There is one notable exception to this: pairing up with someone less experienced
  than you for the express purpose of having a mentorship relationship can be
  a very fulfilling experience. However, you need to make sure you're both on
  board with this, and understand that the less experienced partner may need
  some hand-holding throughout the project.


Communication
-------------

Good communication is essential to working productively in a team. We suggest
that, at the very least, you meet in person at the start of each project
to decide on a plan for completing the project (we provide
some pointers on this below), and then plan to check in with each other
at least every 1-2 days. Take into account that
this doesn't have to be an in-person meeting: you could simply chat online or
have a quick call. These check-ins can also be pretty informal: in fact,
instead of setting a specific time to meet every 1-2 days, you may simply
settle into a routine of regularly chatting online about the project.

Regardless of how or when you check in with each other, here are a few things you may want to discuss:

- *What are you each working on?* Provide a quick overview of what you're working
  on at the moment, and what you expect to work on in the next few days. It can
  be specially useful to discuss what (if anything) has changed since your last check-in,
  and what you expect to get done by the next check-in.

- *Are we on track?* We encourage you not to frame your check-in in terms of
  "what work have you done?" and, instead, in terms of holistically assessing whether you
  are on track to complete the project.

  Most notably, it can be perfectly normal to not get any work done from one check-in to another!
  This may be something you already expected (e.g., at your previous check-in,
  you may have told your partner that you had a midterm coming up in another class,
  and that you had to focus on that), or something unexpected (your dog got sick
  and you had to spend all day at the vet). In any case, a frequent check-in can
  allow you to frequently reassess whether you are still on track, and whether
  you need to make any adjustments to your plan.

- *Do you need help with anything?* Even if you've taken responsibility for one
  part of the project, that doesn't mean that your partner can't help you with it.
  If you're stuck on something, this is a good moment to bring it up.


Sometimes, you will make a somewhat firm commitment to get something done by an
agreed upon deadline, specially as the actual deadline for a project gets closer.
Some of those times, you may not be able to get that work done (for any number of
reasons) and it is important that you communicate this to your project partner as
soon as possible (ideally as soon as it becomes clear you won't be able to meet
the deadline you agreed on, instead of waiting for that deadline to pass).
While it can be tough to admit you may not be able to do something you committed
to doing, having an early and frank discussion about it gives the two of you an
opportunity to regroup and figure out how to stay on track.

It is also important that the two of you understand that this is a *perfectly normal*
aspect of software development: sometimes you estimate that something will take you
one hour and it turns out to be a ten hour task (or maybe it *was* a one hour task,
but you got sidetracked by something else). This happens to even the most
seasoned software developers, and communicating frequently and in a positive, constructive,
and non-judgemental manner allows developers to make adjustments to their plans.
This is another reason why frequent check-ins are important: they can help you
catch these issues sooner rather than later.
