The code in this directory provides some basic examples of how to
build a dispatch table to process messages of the following form:

    <op> <op1> <op2>

There are two examples: one where <op> is an integer code 
(0: Addition, 1: Subtraction, 2: Multiplication, 3: Division),
and one where <op> is a string (ADD, SUB, MLT, DIV). In both
cases, <op1> and <op2> are integer operands.

The message is specified through the command line, and a
dispatch table is used to call the appropriate function.
The files are:

handlers.c / handlers.h
The handler functions.

dispatch-int-one.c
Solution with integer operation code and no dispatch table

dispatch-int-two.c
Solution with integer operation code and dispatch table.

dispatch-str-one.c
Solution with string operation code and dispatch table.

dispatch-str-two.c
Solution with string operation code and dispatch table.
We use the HANDLER_ENTRY macro to construct the table.
